# First-Trial
This is my first trial of Git Hub since long time. First professional usage.
I am working for Cronos Luxembourg.
We are in a strange worldwide period were 4 milliard people are obliged to stay at home, like a prison.
A virus that we transmit by respiration called COVID-19 is threatening us. Some people are obliged to go out to work and they contract the disease. The disease is very strange, it threatens all nature distractors.
